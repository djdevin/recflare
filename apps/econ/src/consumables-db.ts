 * instance: unlike avatar items (own-once, keyed by their desc), consumables stack, so
 * each purchase inserts a fresh row carrying its own id, count and created_at.
 *
 * Granted at purchase time (`POST /api/storefronts/v2/buyItem`, when the gift-drop
 * carries a `ConsumableItemDesc`) and read back by `GET /api/consumables/v2/getUnlocked`,
 * which groups a player's rows by `consumable_item_desc` into the client's unlocked-
 * consumable DTO — its `Ids`/`CreatedAts` are these per-instance columns and `Count`
 * their sum.
 *
 * This worker (`econ`) owns the table and its migration — see apps/econ/migrations/
 * 0005_consumable.sql.
